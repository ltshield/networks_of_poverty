This was because I was interested in seeing if there was any
kind of formulaic relationship between the variables in 
determining final wealth.

Learned about the shap and seaborn libraries, got to use a model
from sklearn, and got to use a genetic algorithm library to
try and find an equation to explain their relationship.

As we see, the simulation, at least where I have it now,
is more greatly influenced by the loan values and the interest
rates than anything else. (By a landslide). Which makes sense
given that those values are what result in an exponential growth
curve and therefore divergent behavior.
